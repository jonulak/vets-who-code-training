# CLI Advantages vs GUI

## Performance

- **Speed:** CLIs outperform GUIs when it comes to speed, especially for complex tasks, as they do not need to devote system resources towards updating the UI. This makes them a better option for tasks that are time sensitive. The speed advantage of CLIs is not only in hardware performance, however, as CLIs also allow users to work more efficiently as the interface is the same or nearly the same from one CLI to another.
- **Resource Consumption:** CLIs typically need fewer resources to run than GUIs as they do not need the extra overhead to manage the UI. This makes them more suitable for systems with limited hardware such as a server. 
- **Task Automation:** CLIs are more suitable to automating tasks due to built in scripting languages and the ability to run batch operations.

## Versatility

- **Complex Task Management:** Due to the precision and flexibility of commands, CLIs provide greater control when managing complex tasks. This makes them more useful for tasks like system administration & programming. Powerful command line tools can also be combined in a number of ways. One example of this is [pipelines](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pipelines.html) which allow the output of one command to become the input of another. One use-case where this would be useful would be to fetch some data from a URL or API which could then be used as an input to another command.
- **Batch Processing:** CLIs can easily perform repeated operations with a single command or a script, making them a better choice for batch operations than GUIs. For example, a simple bash script can perform an operation on an entire directory. In only 5 lines of code, the example below will print the name of every file and folder within the current folder and can easily be modified into something more powerful.

        #!/bin/bash

        for file in *
        do
            echo "$file"
        done

## User Control

- **Granularity:** CLIs allow users to control the system at a lower level than GUIs, enabling the user more control over their environment. One prominent example of this is the use of [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) in python, which allow the user to maintain a separate environment of python packages for each project and helps to avoid compatibility issues that may arise when different projects depend on different versions of a package.
- **Capability:** CLIs provide a powerful set of tools that allow the user to perform tasks that would be impossible or inconvenient to do with a GUI. Commands like [`grep`](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html) and [`find`](https://ss64.com/bash/find.html) allow the user to filter through large amounts of data which would be tedious or impossible to do using a GUI. Furthermore, the output of those commands can then be fed into other commands allowing for narrowly targeted automations.

## Community & Documentation

- **Open Source:** A multitude of open-source CLI tools are available that users can incorporate into their workflow or implement in task automation. For example, GitHub has an [open source CLI tool](https://github.com/cli/cli) for managing code repositories through the command line.
- **Documentation and Community Support:** Many open-source CLI tools have active communities that contribute to their development and provide support. Tools like [GitHub issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) allow users to submit issues such as bug fixes and feature requests to the community which can then be used as a starting point for contributions.
