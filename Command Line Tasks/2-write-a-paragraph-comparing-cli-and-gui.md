# CLI vs GUI
There are several key differences between the CLI and GUI that should be known when deciding which one is most appropriate for a specific task. The CLI is a text based interface which excels at performing complex taks, is resource efficient, and can help automate tasks through scripting and batch processing. Limitations of the CLI are that it has a steeper learning curve, is not as intuitive as a GUI, and does not provide visual feedback. Some scenarios where a CLI would be preferred are for batch operations or managing remote resources where a GUI would not be efficient. GUIs on the other hand, excel at performing simple tasks, provide visual feedback, and are more accessible for beginners. Limitations of a GUI are that they are more resource intensive, performing repeated operations can be time consuming, and tasks cannot be automated. Some scenarios where a GUI would be preferred are simple file operations such as moving files from one folder to another and basic tasks such as reading a file.
